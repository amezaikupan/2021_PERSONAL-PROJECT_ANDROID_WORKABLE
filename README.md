# 2021_PERSONAL-PROJECT_ANDROID_WORKABLE
Project for android: Workable. It's a project on smarter note-taking and tracking, with photo archiving functions, categorized by project.


This is an android project I work on while I was in my last year of high school. Looking back, I was so naive to think that I can learn to program by reading code snippets and following bug codes on Stack Overflow without learning the fundamental. I've grown since then, and looking back, I'm still proud of this program, and my brave naive self.
